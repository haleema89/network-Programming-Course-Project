## Introduction
This project is a Python-based client-server application that provides access to online news
The server communicates with NewsAPI and supports multiple client connections
Users can request and view news headlines and sources using various search options.
## Decsciption of the project
This initiative focuses on developing a complete client-server system for delivering news services. The server is structured to manage several client connections simultaneously through the use of socket programming methods. It retrieves current news information from NewsAPI, processes that data, and saves the resulting content in . JSON format, making it easy to access and manage. On the client end, users can engage with a user-friendly, menu-driven interface. This feature enables them to search for news articles and sources using different criteria, such as keywords, country, and category. The project demonstrates a practical application of fundamental principles including networking, API integration, file handling, and organized data exchange among distributed systems.
